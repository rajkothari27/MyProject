the collection frame work provides a well designed set of
interfaces and classes for storing and manipulating
group of data as single unit

Benfits of collection framework :
1. represent  group of data as a single entity
2. size is expandable (like array size )
3. can store similiar (homogenous data) and diffrent (hetrogenous data ) types of data
4.  classes are abstract data type (has predefined structures and methods )

interfaces in collection framework :
1. collection (interface name ) - this has abstract method , it is root (Parent)interface

2. list (interface name ) (list interface extends collection interface )-
2.1 duplicates allowed
2.2 insertion order must be preserved
2.3 ArrayList , linked list , vector , stack are the implementation classes //stack is a child class of vector

3. set (interface name ) (set interface extends collection interface )-
3.1 a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements
3.2 insertion order is not preserved
3.3 hashset,linkedhasset are the classes implemented set interface //linkedhasset is a child class of hashset

4.Sorted set -
4.1 child interface of set
4.2 cannot contain duplicate element
4.3 some sorted order

5. NavigableSet -
5.1 child interface of sorted set
5.2 it defines several methods for navigation purpose
5.3 tree set is implementation class

6. Queue -
6.1 child interface of collection
6.2 priority queue , blocking queue , linkedblocking queue , priority blocking queue classes

1. Map (diffrent from collection framework)-
1.1 it is used to represent group of object as key value pair
1.2 map is not a child interface of collection
1.3 key and values botha re objects
1.4 key must be unique but values can repeat
1.5 hashmap,linkedhashmap,weakhashmap,identityhashmap,hashtable,propertise

1.2 SortedMap -
1.2.1 it is used to represent group of object as key value pair
1.2.2 child interface of map
1.2.3 some sorting order

1.3 Navigable map -
1.3.1 chilod interface od sorted map
1.3.2 TreeMap is implementation class

comparable - interface for default sorting
comparator - interface for customized sorting

Utilitiy classes:
1.collections
2.arrays
