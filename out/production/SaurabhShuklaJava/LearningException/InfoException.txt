throw is used when we want to thow our exception
catch is used to catch our thrown exception


there are two tupes of exception :
checked exception are complie time exception or also IO exception (input output operations )
unchecked exception are run time exception  (arrayindexout of bond , null pointer  )

the code written in finally block will run anyhow , even our catch will not work and java runs own catch block still finally block will run first and then
java catch will work

why we throw exception object :
java cannopt recognize exceptional situation of bussiness logic or we want to throw our own error message

checked exception or io exception :
this exception forces programmers to deal with exception that may be thrown
example: io exception , sql exception , illegal thread state exception etc

checked means they will be checked at complie time itself
