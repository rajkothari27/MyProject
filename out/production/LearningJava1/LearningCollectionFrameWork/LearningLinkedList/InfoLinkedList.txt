linked list has nodes they are pointing to the one node ahead of it because of sequence
while array list has constant indexing

node is a memomry block and they are not constant but the node has pointer that points to the sequencal node ahead of it
but every node is not sequencial placing in the memory block

all list allows duplicate values

node insertation does not have shifting , it changes the pointing

accessing nth element in linked list is costly , while arraylist is quick

linked list has two nodes that is called dubly link list one point ahead node and one pointer pointing behind node
null value is accepted

linked does not have intial capcity like array list
