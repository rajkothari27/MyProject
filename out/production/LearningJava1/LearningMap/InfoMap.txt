map does not implement collection interface
map is used to store key value pair , 1 entry is a pair of object one is key one is value
map is collection of key and value
key cannot be repeated
map has inner interface called map.entry

HashMap:
1.contains value based on key
2.hash table data structure is used
3. contains only unique element
4. may have one null key and multiple null value

 Hash Table:
 this is a thread safe version of hash map
 unsorted and unordered
 hash table dont allow null value

 LinkedHashMap:
 subclass of hash map
 insertion order is maintained
 slower insertion and deletion
 hybrid data structure (doubly linked list and hash table)

 SortedMap:
 child interface of map
 whenever a group of key value pair needs to be sorted in some sorted order
 we use sorted map
 sorting logic applied on key

 navigable map:
 child interface of sorted map
 several utility methods it provides to navigate in sorted map

 Tree Map:
 it implements naviagable map
 sorted order is maintained
 not thread sfe
 map is sorted according to natural ordering of its key or by a comparator
 red black tree based navigable map implementation
